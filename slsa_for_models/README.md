# SLSA for Models

This example uses [SLSA L3 GitHub generator][slsa-generator] to generate SLSA
provenance for ML models in GitHub Actions. This happens during a
[workflow][workflow] which takes as input the format to save the model into.

[SLSA][slsa] was originally developed for traditional software to protect
against tampering with builds, such as in the [Solarwinds attack][solarwinds],
and this project is a proof of concept that the _same supply chain protections
can be applied to ML_.

When users download a given version of a model they can also check its provenance.
This can be integrated in the model hub and/or model serving platforms: for example
the model serving pipeline could validate provenance for all new models before
serving them. However, the verification can also be done manually, on demand by
using [the SLSA verifier][slsa-verifier] repository.

As an additional benefit, having provenance for a model allows users to react
to vulnerabilities in a training framework: they can quickly determine if a
model needs to be retrained because it was created using a vulnerable version.

To test, fork this repository, then head over to the Actions tab and select the
"SLSA for ML models example" workflow. Since the workflow has a
`workflow_dispatch` trigger, it can be invoked on demand: click the `Run
workflow` button, then select the value for the "Name of the model" argument.

The supported formats are:

| Workflow Argument            | Training Framework | Model format                    |
|------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| `tensorflow_model.keras`     | TensorFlow         | Keras format (default)          |
| `tensorflow_hdf5_model.h5`   | TensorFlow         | Legacy HDF5 format              |
| `tensorflow_hdf5.weights.h5` | TensorFlow         | Legacy HDF5 weights only format |
| `pytorch_model.pth`          | PyTorch            | PyTorch default format          |
| `pytorch_full_model.pth`     | PyTorch            | PyTorch complete model format   |
| `pytorch_jitted_model.pt`    | PyTorch            | PyTorch TorchScript format      |

After the workflow finishes execution, there will be two archives in the
"Artifacts" section: one is the model that was trained and the other one is the
SLSA provenance attached to the model.

To verify the provenance, download both archives, unzip each and then run
`slsa-verifier`, making sure to replace the `--source-uri` argument with the
_path to your fork_. For example, for a PyTorch model, which has been [built on
this repository](https://github.com/google/model-transparency/actions/runs/6646816974):

```bash
[...]$ slsa-verifier verify-artifact \
       --provenance-path pytorch_model.pth.intoto.jsonl \
       --source-uri github.com/google/model-transparency \
       pytorch_model.pth
Verified signature against tlog entry index 45419124 at URL: https://rekor.sigstore.dev/api/v1/log/entries/24296fb24b8ad77a98dd03d23a78657e7f1efd3d9bea6988abbf23a72290a4ec7dc35c9edeab7ee1
Verified build using builder "https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml@refs/tags/v1.9.0" at commit ac26cbf66849cfec6f29747f4525180595c7eef0
Verifying artifact pytorch_model.pth: PASSED

PASSED: Verified SLSA provenance
```

The verification of provenance can be done just before the model gets loaded in
the serving pipeline.

## Future Work

While most of the ML models are currently too expensive to train, future work will
cover the training of ML models that require access to accelerators (i.e., GPUs, TPUs)
or that require multiple hours for training.

### Directory Format
TensorFlow also supports saving models in `SavedModel` format. This is
a directory-based serialization format and currently we don't fully support
this. We can generate SLSA provenance for all the files in the directory but
there are caveats regarding verification. Furthermore, because there is a
difference between the hashes generated by provenance and the hash generated
during model signing, we have decided to add support for these model formats at
a future time, after standardizing a way to generate and verify provenance in
SLSA (in general, not just for ML).
